                            <h2>Healthy Eating on a Tight Budget</h2>
                            <p>

                                It’s universally known that eating healthy isn't always the cheapest. Whether you’re a
                                full-time student or starting out your first full-time position, budgeting for groceries
                                isn't always the first thing that comes to mind; and let's be real, it gets
                                overwhelming. There are a lot of external factors that determine the way you spend your
                                money at that moment. From rent, to personal hobbies, and being active in your social
                                life, the additional expense of groceries end up making the task seem less important.
                                Truth is, as someone starting out in their fitness journey, choosing to skip that step
                                can be detrimental to your progress. In order to reach your goals in the timeframe you
                                have set for yourself, you will see that something will have to change.<br><br>

                                The quicker you change your diet, the happier you will be with your results. When
                                starting out in the gym, most don’t realize that exercise and healthy eating go hand in
                                hand with one another. Eating properly is the best way to ensure that you can maximize
                                your performance in the gym. If you aren’t fueling your body before the gym and in your
                                everyday life, the chances of you feeling the best you can are not as high. There are
                                three kinds of macronutrients - carbohydrates, fats, and proteins that your body uses in
                                large amounts. Having a healthy balance of all three helps your body function the way it
                                needs to when going through high levels of training.<br><br>

                                There are many different ways that you can make sure you’re eating the right amounts for
                                the right price. Here are 5 tips that we think you should try on your upcoming grocery
                                trip.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Plan your meals.<br>
                                    If you want to save money while shopping at the grocery store, planning is
                                    essential. Set aside a day to plan out your meals. Double check your pantry to make
                                    sure you are out of a certain ingredient or have anything to use before it expires
                                    before buying any more at the store. Plan to purchase what you know that you’ll eat
                                    before getting some more. This way, you won't end up having to throw anything out.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Make your list and check it twice.<br>
                                    Once you have planned out your meals and are on your way to the grocery store. Be
                                    sure to only stick to what you need on that list. It’s easy to get sidetracked at
                                    the store when you are presented with so many options. Unintended purchases can
                                    cause your cart to become more expensive by the item, so make sure you are sticking
                                    to that list!
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Avoid buying highly processed foods.<br>
                                    Processed foods such as soda, chips, cookies, and prepackaged meals may seem
                                    appealing, but are never a good idea. Not only do these foods throw off your
                                    macronutrient balance from the sugar it holds, it also is incredibly expensive. It
                                    is better to spend your money on high nutrient food that will leave you feeling your
                                    best.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Shop for produce that is in season.<br>
                                    When in season, there is an abundance of local produce that will generally make the
                                    price of them become cheaper. At this stage they also tend to be the highest in
                                    nutrients. If you are worried that you may not use it all at that moment, feel free
                                    to store them in the freezer to use them in your next meal.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Cook in big portions and use the rest as leftovers.<br>
                                    Making food in larger portions will end up saving you much more time and money.
                                    Leftovers from dinner can be used as lunch for the next day and even transformed
                                    into a new meal for the night. Having some food left over can help prevent you from
                                    eating out because you don't feel like making dinner from scratch.
                                </li><br>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Eating better doesn't have to break the bank. There are lots of great options, rich in
                                nutrients that you can find even on a tight budget. It’s important to not let yourself
                                become overwhelmed by the amount, because as they say, there's no price on your health!
