                            <h2>Healthy Eating on a Tight Budget</h2>
                            <p>
                                Keeping your fitness goals during the holiday season is a challenge that is easier said
                                than done. After holidays that are notorious for having hectic schedules and eating all
                                sorts of goods such as Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas make it harder for anyone
                                to track and stay on top of their fitness goals. We also see that around this time,
                                local gyms tend to reduce their hours of operations or even close on those holidays
                                making it even harder to help ensure that you are staying consistent.<br><br>

                                While this time of year may be alot on an individual, it doesn't have to stop you from
                                becoming who you want to be in your fitness journey. As you’re going through your to-do
                                list, keep these tips in mind the next time you find it hard to keep going!

                            </p>
                            <ol>

                                    Keep Moving - All you need is 20 minutes. <br>
                                    We constantly stress the importance of getting a quick workout no matter how much
                                    time you have. Sitting/resting for too long can be hazardous to your health and your
                                    fitness goals. Getting up and performing tasks such as walking or even cleaning the
                                    house can help reduce the risk of diabetes and other major health issues.

                                    Stay Hydrated.<br>
                                    Whether you are exercising or not, it is important to stay hydrated throughout the
                                    day. There are times when your brain mixes up the signals between hunger and thirst.
                                    In times when you feel that you may be hungry, drink a cup or two of water, then
                                    wait a little bit to see if this “hunger” has subsided. This is one of the best ways
                                    to avoid overeating.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Keep a Healthy Snack.<br>
                                    Keeping an emergency snack of something that is nutritious and ready to eat can be a
                                    lifesaver. Another method to help avoid over-eating is by bringing a snack with you
                                    wherever you go. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you are stuck
                                    somewhere longer than you are expecting or would like to avoid a fast food option,
                                    keeping a bag of nuts like peanuts or almonds in your bag is a great source of
                                    protein and energy.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Plan Ahead.<br>
                                    If you know you have a busy week ahead. Take a moment to sit down and see where you
                                    have free time to fit in some exercise. Planning your exercise days in advance is
                                    the best way to ensure that you don’t skip the gym simply because “You don’t have
                                    the time.” If you are unable to get to the gym that week, find at least 15 minutes
                                    to do body weight exercises. It will feel different than your full routine, but
                                    you’ll feel a lot better once you’re done.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>
                                    Keep Your Stress Levels in Check.<br>
                                    This time of year tends to be when stress levels are at an all time high. Increased
                                    levels of stress can then lead to increased levels of hunger. Try to remember to
                                    take moments to prioritize your mental health throughout the day. When you take a
                                    quick breather it helps motivate you to move on with the rest of your day.
                                </li><br>

                                Don't let the holiday season take you away from where you want and need to be in your
                                fitness journey. Keeping up your routine in some form is important to getting through
                                this hectic season. Taking these small steps help you stay on track to your better
                                living!
